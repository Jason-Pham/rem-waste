## BUG-001 — Step 2 validation error persists after the user fixes the condition

- **Category**: State transition
- **Severity**: S3 — moderate (visible UX defect; no data loss)
- **Priority**: P2 — fix in current sprint
- **Reporter**: QA · 2026-04-15
- **Build (reported)**: `2026-04-15:milestone-2`
- **Status**: **Fixed in `2026-04-16:milestone-3`** — `setValidation(null)` now invoked from each waste-type checkbox `onChange` and from the plasterboard radio `onChange`. Verified manually + covered by manual case `WT-N-02`.

### Environment

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| URL | `https://jason-pham.github.io/rem-waste/` |
| Browser | Chromium 131 |
| OS | macOS 15.3 (darwin 25.3.0) |
| Viewport | 1280 × 800 |
| Backend | MSW mock (in-browser) |

### Steps to reproduce

1. Load the app at `/`.
2. Enter `SW1A 1AA` and submit; pick any address; continue to Step 2.
3. On Step 2, tick **Plasterboard** only (do not tick General or Heavy; do not select a handling option).
4. Click **Continue**.
5. Observe the validation message: *"Choose how much plasterboard is in your load."*
6. Without clicking Continue again, tick **Under 10% of load** in the handling options.

### Expected result

The validation message should disappear as soon as the user satisfies its stated condition — i.e., the moment a handling option is selected. This is the common pattern (live validation after first submit) for wizard forms.

### Actual result

The validation message remains visible until the user clicks **Continue** a second time. There is no visual confirmation that the user's fix was recognised.

### Impact

- Users, especially on mobile with limited screen space, read the persistent error as "something is still wrong" and may hesitate or change a correct input.
- Fails WCAG 3.3.3 *Error Suggestion* — suggestion should reflect current state, not the state at the last submission.

### Root-cause suspicion

In `ui/src/steps/WasteTypeStep.tsx`, `setValidation(null)` is only invoked inside `handleSubmit` (line 56). No onChange handler clears it. Fix: call `setValidation(null)` from the plasterboard-option radio `onChange` (and optionally from each checkbox).

### Evidence

- Before-fix screenshot: 
  ![BUG-001 Before](./evidence/bugs/BUG-001-before.png)
  *validation message still visible after radio is selected.*
- After-fix screenshot: 
  ![BUG-001 After](./evidence/bugs/BUG-001-after.png)
  *message clears immediately on selection.*
- Original source line (pre-fix): `ui/src/steps/WasteTypeStep.tsx` — only clear-site was `handleSubmit`.
- Fix diff: `setValidation(null)` added to `handleGeneralToggle`, `handlePlasterboardToggle`, `handlePlasterboardOption`, and the Heavy checkbox `onChange`.

### Test coverage

- Manual: `manual-tests.md` TC-N04 (reproduces the scenario; marked Pass because the initial validation *does* appear — but doesn't explicitly verify the auto-clear fix).
- Recommendation: add an explicit automated assertion that the validation message hides after the option is picked.

## BUG-002 — Back-navigation from Step 2 re-fires the postcode lookup

- **Category**: Performance / state
- **Severity**: S4 — minor (wasted network, correct rendering)
- **Priority**: P3 — backlog
- **Reporter**: QA · 2026-04-15
- **Build**: `2026-04-16:milestone-2`

### Environment

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| URL | `https://jason-pham.github.io/rem-waste/` |
| Browser | Chromium 131 |
| Network tab | Open throughout |
| Backend | MSW mock (in-browser) |

### Steps to reproduce

1. Open DevTools → Network, filter by `fetch/xhr`. Clear the log.
2. Enter `SW1A 1AA`, submit, pick an address, click **Continue** to reach Step 2.
3. Click **Back** on Step 2.
4. Observe the Network tab.

### Expected result

No new `POST /api/postcode/lookup` fires. The Step 1 view should rehydrate from the component tree (already-fetched results, already-selected address).

### Actual result

A fresh `POST /api/postcode/lookup` fires every time the user lands on Step 1 with a valid postcode already in state. The spinner flashes briefly, and results are replaced rather than restored.

### Impact

- Wasted network for every back-navigation.
- For `BS1 4DJ`, this counter increments are real. A user who hits *Back* between the retry and continuing to Step 2 creates a trail of lookups in the mock counter that would be visible in logs of a real backend.
- Flashing spinner on revisits reads as instability.

### Root-cause suspicion

`ui/src/steps/PostcodeStep.tsx` has a `useEffect` on mount that calls `runLookup(initialPostcode)` whenever `initialPostcode` is non-empty. When the parent (`App.tsx`) conditionally renders `PostcodeStep` on Back, the component remounts and the effect fires again.

Fix options:
- Lift the lookup result up to `App` and pass it down so PostcodeStep doesn't need to re-fetch.
- Cache by postcode in a ref or React Query-style store.

### Evidence

- Network-tab screenshot: 
  ![BUG-002 Network](./evidence/bugs/BUG-002-network.png)
  *second POST /api/postcode/lookup visible after Back.*
- Source: `ui/src/steps/PostcodeStep.tsx` `useEffect` on mount that calls `runLookup(initialPostcode)` whenever `initialPostcode` is non-empty.

### Test coverage

- No direct automated test — easy to add via `page.waitForRequest` with a count after Back.

## BUG-003 — Mock's BS1 4DJ retry counter leaks across "Book another skip" restarts

- **Category**: State transition (mock/backing-data)
- **Severity**: S3 — moderate (demo-fidelity defect; hides the intended error-state in a second run)
- **Priority**: P2
- **Reporter**: QA · 2026-04-15
- **Build**: `2026-04-16:milestone-2`

### Environment

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| URL | `https://jason-pham.github.io/rem-waste/` |
| Browser | Chromium 131 |
| Backend | MSW mock (in-browser) |
| Fixture | `BS1 4DJ` per `ASSESSMENT.md §4` — "500 error on first call, success on retry" |

### Steps to reproduce

1. Open the app.
2. Enter `BS1 4DJ`, click **Find address**. Observe the 500 error and **Retry**.
3. Click Retry, select any address, continue through Steps 2, 3, 4 and confirm a booking.
4. On the success screen, click **Book another skip**.
5. Enter `BS1 4DJ` again and click Find.

### Expected result

Per `ASSESSMENT.md §4`, the `BS1 4DJ` fixture is "500 error on first call, success on retry." A reviewer (human or automated) running the demo end-to-end to exercise the retry path for the *second* booking expects to see the error state again on the first call.

### Actual result

Addresses return immediately on the first call (200). The error-state path cannot be demonstrated a second time without a full browser refresh or a developer-only `POST /_mocks/reset`.

### Impact

- Evaluators exercising the error-path twice will miss the retry behaviour the second time and may mark the fixture as missing.
- Screen recordings of multiple runs would show inconsistent behaviour for the same postcode.
- Branches/state-transition coverage in the demo is effectively one-shot.

### Root-cause suspicion

`ui/src/mocks/fixtures/state.ts` holds `bs1RetryCounter` as module-scoped state in the service worker. The "Book another skip" button calls `setState(INITIAL)` in `App.tsx` — this resets the client but not the mock counter. Playwright calls `POST /_mocks/reset` in its `freshPage` fixture to work around this, but there is no equivalent user-facing reset.

Fix options:
- Reset the counter on each App-level `setState(INITIAL)` via a call to `/_mocks/reset` (dev-only).
- Change the counter to be "next-call-is-first" based on postcode + time-since-last-call (e.g., reset after 30 s of inactivity).
- Document the behaviour in the README and require reviewers to refresh for repeated demos.

### Evidence

- Side-by-side screenshot:
  ![BUG-003 Counter Leak](./evidence/bugs/BUG-003-counter-leak.png)
  *first run shows error; second run after "Book another skip" returns 200 directly.*
- Source: `ui/src/mocks/fixtures/state.ts` (module-scope singleton), `ui/src/App.tsx::INITIAL` (does not trigger mock reset).

### Test coverage

- Manual: `manual-tests.md` TC-T01 reproduces the first-time behaviour. A second run would need a beforeEach reset — implicit in `test-fixtures.ts::freshPage`.
- Recommendation: extend automated `freshPage` reset to also fire from the app on `setState(INITIAL)` in dev builds so manual demos stay truthful.

## BUG-004 — Step 1 unselects the previously chosen address when the user re-submits the same postcode

- **Category**: State transition
- **Severity**: S3 — moderate (recoverable but unexpected; user must re-select)
- **Priority**: P2 — fix in current sprint
- **Reporter**: QA · 2026-04-16
- **Build**: `2026-04-16:milestone-3`

### Environment

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| URL | `https://jason-pham.github.io/rem-waste/` |
| Browser | Chromium 131 (Playwright) |
| OS | macOS 15.3 (darwin 25.3.0) |
| Viewport | 1280 × 800 |
| Backend | MSW mock (in-browser) |

### Steps to reproduce

1. Load the app at `/`.
2. Type `SW1A 1AA` into the postcode field. Click **Find address**.
3. Select the first address (`10 Downing Street`). Confirm the radio is checked and **Continue** is enabled.
4. Without changing the postcode value, click **Find address** again.

### Expected result

A re-lookup of an unchanged postcode should preserve the user's selection. The component already documents this intent at `PostcodeStep.tsx` `runLookup`:

```ts
// Only clear the selection if the postcode actually changed.
if (normalized !== lastAttempted.current) setSelectedId(null);
```

### Actual result

After the second click on **Find address**:
- The previously selected address radio is unchecked.
- **Continue** is disabled.
- User has to re-pick the address (or re-pick a different one) to proceed.

Reproduced via Playwright probe:

```
After resubmit — same address still checked? false
After resubmit — Continue disabled?           true
```

### Impact

- Annoying on a happy path: any user who double-taps the lookup button (common on mobile) is silently knocked back a step.
- Worse on `M1 1AE` (the latency fixture) where users naturally retry because the spinner is slow — the prior selection vanishes after the second response arrives.
- Falsely communicates "your address is gone" when the address list is in fact identical.

### Root-cause suspicion

Two interacting defects in `ui/src/steps/PostcodeStep.tsx`:

1. `handleSubmit` unconditionally calls `setSelectedId(null)` *before* delegating to `runLookup`, regardless of whether the postcode changed.
2. The intended-guard inside `runLookup` is dead code: `lastAttempted.current` is assigned to `normalized` on the line above, so the comparison `normalized !== lastAttempted.current` can never be true.

### Suggested fix

```ts
function handleSubmit(e: React.FormEvent) {
  e.preventDefault();
  const next = normalizePostcode(postcode);
  if (next !== lastAttempted.current) setSelectedId(null);
  void runLookup(postcode);
}
```

…and remove the dead `if` branch inside `runLookup`.

### Evidence

- Screenshot pair:
  ![BUG-004 Before (selected)](./evidence/bugs/BUG-004-before.png)
  
  ![BUG-004 After (unselected after resubmit)](./evidence/bugs/BUG-004-after.png)
- Source: `ui/src/steps/PostcodeStep.tsx` — `handleSubmit` and `runLookup`.

### Test coverage

- No existing manual case directly catches this (TC-T04 only asserts the *changed-postcode* path).
- Recommendation: add a new scenario — "Re-submitting an unchanged postcode preserves the selected address" — and a Playwright assertion in `flow-a-general.spec.ts` after step 1.
